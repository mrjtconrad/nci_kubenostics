How to Run the Diagnostics

To run the diagnostics you must click on the RUN button on the homepage

Once you click on run the cluster diagnostics collection gets initiated. This process can take up to 1 minute to gather all of your diagnostics data. Once the diagnostics are collected you will see them load up in a terminal screen at the bottom of your window. Scroll down to get a full view of them.
